Website refactored to follow accessibility standards thus optimizing it for search engines.

Why this is important?

- Poorly optimized media leads to a loss in revenue
    - If you're website takes longer than 4 seconds to load, then you've already lost 1/4 of your revenue
- Better accessebility 
    - So that people with disabilities can use assistive technologies to view your site
- The more your site is optimized the better your ranking on Googles search engine will be
