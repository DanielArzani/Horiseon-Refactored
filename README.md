## Purpose

Website refactored to follow accessibility standards thus optimizing it for search engines.

## Why this is important?

Poorly optimized media leads to a loss in revenue

- If you're website takes longer than 4 seconds to load, then you've already lost 1/4 of your revenue

Better accessebility

- So that people with disabilities can use assistive technologies to view your site
  The more your site is optimized the better your ranking on Googles search engine will be
